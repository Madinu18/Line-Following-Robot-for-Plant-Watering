# Line Following Robot for Plant Watering

![3D Design 1](https://github.com/Madinu18/Line-Following-Robot-for-Plant-Watering/assets/85431559/ea3d0af6-6ef2-4c12-9423-e38bdb0c7f8b)

## Overview

This project involves the design of a Line Following Robot for automated plant watering. The robot is equipped with sensors to follow a predefined path and a watering mechanism to ensure efficient watering of plants. It waters plants when detecting a green color and stops upon encountering a blue color. You can view the implementation of this project on my YouTube channel at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmG6FiPu7Q. The 3D model design, created using Fusion360, can be found in the file '3D Design.f3z.'

## Features

- Line following capability for precise navigation.
- Automatic plant watering system.

## Requirements

List the hardware and software requirements needed to run the project. For example:
- Arduino Uno or similar microcontroller.
- L293D Motor Driver Shield for Arduino Mega or Uno.
- Infrared sensors for line following.
- TCS3200 color sensor recognition Detector module sensor
- Water pump and tubing for plant watering.
- Arduino IDE for code upload.
- Some battery holder and battery

## Setup

Provide step-by-step instructions on setting up the project. Include installation steps, hardware connections, and any additional configuration required. For example:

1. wiring your hardware like in wiring.jpg
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to the microcontroller.

## Usage

Explain how to use the robot for plant watering. Include any user inputs, commands, or interactions. For example:

1. You maust make the track for the robot using black tape.
2. Get a green sheet of paper or something equivalent with a green hue, and obtain a blue sheet of paper or something similar with a blue tint
3. Place the green sheet of paper whatever you want, place the blue one for the ending of the track.
4. Place your robot at start point, and then turn the switch on
